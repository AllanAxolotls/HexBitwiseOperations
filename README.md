# Hex Bitwise Operations

At the local variable Bitwise, change it to the function you want to run.
In order to run this, you need the Löve2D application with the extension in VSCode, so that it can run, or just run the .love file that I included, though
I'm not sure if you need to download Löve2D first.
However, you can't really edit the code without getting rid of the .love file extension, then you need to re-add it, but again you would need Löve2D for that.
